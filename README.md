# Rummy

Created by Aryan Singh

This is my final project for CMP 233 (Data Structures and Algorithms).

This is a Java implementation of the card game Rummy. I based the rules off of the description of Rummy on [bicycle cards](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/rummy-rum). Currently all input/output is through the terminal.

## Running Instructions

You simply need to run Client.java and the game will run in the terminal. It starts by printing out the rules of the game so do not worry if you haven't played Rummy before.

This project uses Java 11 features so make sure you have an equivalent or higher version of Java installed.
