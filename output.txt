Welcome to Rummy!
The goal of the game is to get rid of all of your cards.
You get rid of cards by making melds and placing them on the table, or adding to the melds on the table.
A meld is a group of cards of 3 or more cards that makes a set or run.
Set - cards have the same rank like [6♠, 6♦, 6♥]
Run - cards are in order in the same suit like [K♠, A♠, 2♠, 3♠]
You start each turn by drawing a card from either the stock or the discard pile.
Then you will take any actions you wish to take, such as laying down or adding to a meld.
Finally, you will discard a card to end your turn.
Have fun!
